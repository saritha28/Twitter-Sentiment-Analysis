# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - 1.6 Million Tweets

## Overview
This project involves sentiment analysis conducted on a dataset comprising 1.6 million tweets from Twitter. The primary goal is to analyze sentiments expressed within these tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and derive meaningful insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 1.6 million tweets collected from Kaggle. It includes various features such as tweet text, sentiment labels, polarity scores, and relevant metadata.

### Data Source
The specifics of data collection cannot be disclosed here due to Twitter's terms of service. However, the dataset adheres to Twitter's guidelines and does not contain sensitive or personal information.
